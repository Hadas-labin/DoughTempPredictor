# DoughTempPredictor
This project predicts the final temperature of the dough after mixing â€“ before the mixing process even begins.
Using the initial temperatures of the ingredients, the model estimates what the final dough temperature will be, allowing bakers and industrial systems to make adjustments in advance.
A custom Gradient Descent algorithm is used to optimize the accuracy of the multivariable linear regression.
